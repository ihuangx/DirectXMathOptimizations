# DirectX Math Optimizations

This is a playground for my blog series about modern SSE/AVX optimization techniques. The series is located [here](http://nfrechette.github.io/2017/04/11/modern_simd_hardware/).

It uses as a reference the excellent [DirectX Math](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXMath) library.
